## Introduction

This is a project for downloading all videos from a course from [OpenFING](https://open.fing.edu.uy/).

I made this project for my personal use and it is very simple. But I used this to test node-libui library so I did a lot of ugly things while making this project. This resulted in terrible code.

The program does what it is supposed to do and I will never touch this again so the code will remain ugly (forever).
But here it is if you want to use it.
